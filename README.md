# AED R and friends data science study group

This repository contains the materials for the Atlantic Ecology Division's R 
(and friends) data science study group.  The purpose of this group is to work 
together to learn new skills, languages, data science practices, etc. as they 
relate to our research in environmental science.  The primary focus will likely
be R, but the topics we cover will by no means be limited to that and other 
languages and tools are very much encouraged.

# Meeting day and time
We will meet the first Thursday of every month from 2-4 pm.  Location is TBD 
depending on the turnout.

# GitHub and this Repository
This repository is public and thus anyone can access the files; however, only 
collaborators on the repository can add or edit files.  I encourage everyone to 
[sign up for a GitHub account](https://github.com/join), they are free and you 
will be able to take advantage of 
[our issues](https://github.com/usepa/aed_r/issues) for discussions and you can
be added as a collaborator on the repository.

## Repository structure
In order to keep the repository neat and orderly we will impose some best 
practices and enforce a specific structure.  These practices should follow 
typical practices (i.e. README, LICENSE, etc.) so that if you move to 
repositories maintained by others, at least something should look familiar.  All
documentation should be written use markdown.  If you are unfamiliar with 
markdown, the 
[RStudio Markdown Basics](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html) will 
teach you all you need to know (and then some)!

|[notes](notes/)        |General notes about the study group                |
|[workshop](workshop/)  |Materials for the 1-day Intoduction to R workshop  |
|README.md              |This document, provides basic information          |
|LICENSE.md             |Creative Commons Zero Public Domain Dedication     |
|CONTRIBUTING.md        |Lays out best practices and expecations for contributions|

## File naming conventions
So that it is easier for us to find materials and keep things looking orderly, 
we will follow these rules for naming files in the notes and meetings sections:

1. Only use lower case (with the exception of the files listed above).
2. No spaces are allowed in file names.
3. Start out the name with something descriptive followed by the date with year, 
month, day separated by underscore.
4. Use conventions for file extensions (e.g. .md for markdown, .R for R script, 
.py for python etc.).  

For example, `gganimate_example_2016_08_11.R` would be a good file name.
